I have learned that I thrive and chase challenges like it's a game. I never liked doing anything that would bore me to death, challenges have always made me happy and ready to take on whatever it is. Watching shows as a little kid and seeing people coding and hacking and the whole quick aesthetic jargons to show how smart and nerdy they can be kind of gave me goosebumps, to be honest. Now, in the real world, its not just some typing and you get the result you want or just smash your fingers over the keyboard for a few seconds then hack into someone's server. I had to learn that but I still thought coding is pretty amazing.  

  I went to school and minored in Sociology, majored in Criminal Justice then graduated with my MA in Social Work. Not to say that I did not enjoy learning these topics but at one point I realized that that was not the path I wanted to take. I realized after graduating, of course. A bit too late, I know. As my dear mother would say " It was a complete waste of time." A part of me is still happy I got to learn different topics and opened my mind to new discussions.
	
	Now, I decided to study Software Engineering because the idea was always in the back of my mind. From the past few lessons and labs I have went through, I have to say I have felt more happy to do them then my regular day to day job and part of me already knew that I would from the day I signed up. Even though, I've ran onto walls and blocks, I still like learning and going through it. I think Software Engineering is one way to land a job that I would not despise and be completely happy doing it. Quarantine also played part into deciding to study Software Engineering. As I work from home since the lockdown, I have realized that my current job is not something I would like to do for the rest of my life. It does pay the bills and my shelter but I would like to do something that I really enjoy doing. I beleive that is part of being happy in life.
	
	I am very excited about where this will take me in the future and the lessons I will learn. And to conclude, I am ready to finally go do something I would love to do without any boredom, of course.
