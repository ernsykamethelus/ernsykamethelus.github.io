When I first heard about our first project, I can say that I was not as excited as everyone seemed to be. I got nervous and thought about all sorts of things. I thought I was not competent enough to even do the project! But once I got to it and did my reasearch, watched lots and lots of videos, I grew confident. Granted, I was totally blind as the walkthroughs are different but I can say I got over my fear and realized how coding puts me in such good mood. It is definitely something to invest your time in!

I thought about being an introvert and being the most happy when I am at home. Sometimes, maybe a little self date will suffice to treat yourself. Nothing too crazy, nothing too boring either. There is no need to talk, there is no need to drain your energy for no particular reason. Those who love art can get the app and see which event is available depends on the month and choose one that they desire from the PAMM museum. Of course, the events can be minimized due to COVID-19 and the app will make sure the user is aware of it and will send out messages for precautions. It is a pretty simple app and not too much and complicated, which is sometimes preferred. Once the user chooses a month, the user will be able to choose an event that is available.

The scraping part definitely test my patience, I wanted it to be as nice as possible. Yes, two weeks was given but I found myself spend most of the time finding a website that would be easy to scrape and get the information needed. I also have fallen ill which made the timing a bit worse I did not know I was going to go through those blocks but I have made it work as much as I could and made it very simple. To think of it, I like that it is easy to use because then time will not be wasted. I know I have become impatient a few times but it was rewarded by actually finishing the app! I definitely want to invest more time on building more apps to where I am comfortable enough. It is something I am looking forward to and I want to push myself and get with the programming!

Coding is definitely not for everyone, depends on the time, the eager to learn, and the time spent practicing. I want to go forward and learn all that I can and know it will get easier. That thought alone makes me excited!
